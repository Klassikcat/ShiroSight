ShiroSight is an open-source tool for log analysis powered by Large Language Models. It leverages serverless functions and workflows (both DAG and non-DAG) to process and analyze logs using models from providers like OpenAI, Claude, and others. ShiroSight helps teams extract meaningful insights from their log data without the need for complex infrastructure management.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Use resources only when needed without the burden of infrastructure management.
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Leverage various LLM providers including OpenAI, Claude, and others.
